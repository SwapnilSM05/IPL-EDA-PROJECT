# IPL-EDA-PROJECT
A Data Analysis and Visualization Project using Python

In this project, I have done exploratory data analysis on IPL matches where I have tried to answer a few questions and find some insights using the available data. The dataset that I have used in this notebook is IPL (Indian Premier League) dataset posted on Kaggle Datasets sourced from cricsheet. The dataset has information about IPL matches from 2008 to 2022.

The Python packages that I have used in this notebook are:

# NumPy: For numerical computations
# Pandas: For data processing and file input/output
# Matplotlib: For data visualization
# Seaborn: For modern and statistical visualization

### Analysis covered in this project:
# Number of matches played till now.
# Number of IPL seasons.
# Number of matches played in each season.
# Number of matches won by each team.
# Number of finals won by a team.
# Number of stadiums where IPL matches have been conducted.
# Number of matches played in each stadium.
# Top 10 stadiums with maximum matches held.
# Inference and consequences of almost 60% matches being conducted in only 10 stadiums.
# Decision made after winning the toss - bat or field.
# Has Toss-winning helped in Match-winning?
# Toss decision vs win/loss analysis.
# Top 15 player of the match winners.
# Umpires who have umpired in maximum matches.
